		<h1>Music Heals the Soul</h1>
		<p class="paragraph">Machine Gun Kelly is one of the only artists nowadays that are very true to his lyrics. He says things he has experienced in the past whether that be death or success. He does this to relate back to his audience and form a connection with them. Some of my favourite song lyrics come from the song “Glass House” which is a very emotional song dealing with suicidal thoughts and self conflict. </p>
		<div class="background">Lately, I've been sick of livin' and nobody knows how I'm really feelin'
“I always hated to smile, but it keep what is killing me hidden inside
I didn't sign up to be the hero, but I don't want to wind up a villain
I put my daughter to bed, then attempted to kill myself in the kitchen”</div>
